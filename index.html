<h1>Welcome To Mind Aid</h1>
<br>
<p>Welcome to Mind Aid, a not-for-profit charity whose aim it is to connect people who suffer from mental health issues with those who can help them. Before we steer you towards an appropriate care provider, we ask that you take our simple 9 question quiz. There are no wrong answers. It is simply designed to give us a sense of where your mental health currently sits, therefore helping us to ascertain the kind of level of help you might need. This is not designed to give a clinical diagnosis; rather it should be seen as the first step towards a happier and healthier life with a clear and positive mind.</p>

    <h2>Mental Health Facts</h2>
    <p>It has been some time since mental health was first classified as an illness and yet it still retains a dangerous stigma about it. There is a mystery about what it means, and a people continue to reserve caution about openly discussing it. The truth of the matter is that it is an illness and like any other illness, it is treatable. But equally, like any other illness, the sooner you are able to diagnose it, the easier it is to do so. The first step towards tackling the subject and stripping it down to its core is to demystify the truth from the fiction.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="lists">
    <div id="facts-text">
    <ul>
        <li>10% of the world’s population currently suffers from some form of depression.</li>
        <li>1 in every 6 people admit to experiencing a common mental health problem in any given week.</li>
        <li>Depression rates are on the rise, especially in the young, where they have almost doubled in the last decade.</li>
        <li>1 in 5 people under the age of 18 will develop a mental illness in their lifetime.</li>
        <li>Members of the LGBTQ+ community are almost 3 times more likely to experience a mental health condition than other members of society.</li>
        <li>More than 25% of adults living with serious mental illness also struggle with substance abuse.</li>
        <li>Sufferers of mental illness are especially adept at hiding it and can be very reluctant to seek help themselves. If you know anyone who you think might benefit from speaking to us, please put them in touch.</li>

    <h2>Mental Health Fibs</h2>
<p>While the subject of mental illness has been heavily researched in the scientific community, there remains a society-wide ignorance that prevails, stemming from the ingrained taboo that surrounds the wider topic of mental health. People either don’t want to know about it, because it doesn’t affect them, or they don’t want to talk about it for fear of what their friends or colleagues might think of them if they do. As a result, lazy stereo-types and unsubstantiated myths have entered the conversation that hide the truth inside the fiction.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="lists">
    <div id="fibs-text">
    <ul>
        <li>Mental health problems won't affect me. It just isn't true. The statistics show that the chances of you or someone you know fuffereing from mental illness at some juncture is very high.</li>
        <li>Children are too young so suffer from mental issues. Again, the statistics show otherwise. With the prevailance of social media, the strain and pressure focred upon young minds has never been more accute.</li>
        <li>Mental health problems make people violent, antisocial and unpredictable. This is true in less that 5% of cases in sufferes with clinical disorders. The great majority of mental health sufferers are able to hide their illness.</li>
        <li>Suffering from mental illness is proof of some kind of flaw or weakness in my personality. The opposite of this is true. Quite often, it is peple with strong personalities who suffer the most, because they tend to be more reluctant to discuss it.</li>
        <li>In time it will go away. This is the greatest myth of them all. In time, it will embed itself and get worse. Only with help will you start to feel better. You cannot fix this alone.</li>

    <h2>Conditions</h2>
    <p>There are many factors that contribute to the onset of mental illness, including life experiences, such as trauma, which can either be recent or longstanding.  Substance abuse and lifestyle factors can also contribute. As can the kind of work you do and the levels of stress that you find yourself under in your life. And biological factors can also play a part. People with a family history of mental illness are more likely to suffer from it themselves. But the truth is, there is no rule as to from where it comes from, and its causes can vary greatly from one person to the next. Equally, it doesn’t mean that one sufferer is somehow worse or better off than another. It is what it is to the person it afflicts, and each case is unique. Sometimes mild and sometimes severe, and sometimes in combination with other, disorders, there are, however, seven principle illnesses which are follows:</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="lists">
    <div id="conditions-text">
    <ul>
        <li>Depression. When coping with difficult episodes in our lives, a feeling of sadness, worry and a general feeling of depression is quite normal. Most of us are able to move on from it in the days and weeks that follow. But when these feelings make it hard for us to live our lives normally, and when these feelings last into the months and beyond, then clinical depression has set itself in.</li>
        <li>Anxiety. Like depression, it is perfectly natural to feel anxious or worried about things, as long as they are justified. But when those worries rise out of proportion with the problems we are facing, that anxiety can soon spiral into a debilitating disorder which can include panic and phobias.</li>
        <li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). People often joke of being "OCD", but when those obsessions become recurring thoughts the intrude into a person's normal way of thinking and being (quite often when the sufferer is away they are exaggerated), then they have a disorder. </li>
        <li>Bipolar disorder. This is a psychiatric diagnosis that includes episodes of steep mood swings that go from high levels of energy and an elevated mood followed by a deep dive into lethargy and gloom. </li>
        <li>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is an often and well-document bi-product of fighting in war, though by no means the only catylist. Personal assault, both physical and emotional, or life-altering events like road accidents can all contribute.</li>
        <li>Schizophrenia. This is characterised by having disordered thoughts which cause abnormal - and sometimes anti-social - behaviour patterns. There are several different types, including paranoid, disorganised and catatonic, which, if left untreated, can have devastating effects on your life and those around you. </li>
        <li>Personality disorders. This usually develops from a chronic pattern of unstable relationships, creating a poor self-image of oneself. Like Bipolar Disorder, it can result in severe mood swings and impulsive, often reckless, behaviour.</li>
