    <h2>Mental Health Facts</h2>
    <p>It has been some time since mental health was first classified as an illness and yet it still retains a dangerous stigma about it. There is a mystery about what it means, and a people continue to reserve caution about openly discussing it. The truth of the matter is that it is an illness and like any other illness, it is treatable. But equally, like any other illness, the sooner you are able to diagnose it, the easier it is to do so. The first step towards tackling the subject and stripping it down to its core is to demystify the truth from the fiction.</p>
